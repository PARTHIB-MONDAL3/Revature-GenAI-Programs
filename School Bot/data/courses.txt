  • Exploratory Data## 📄 Suggested Layout for the **`courses.txt`** File  
The chatbot splits the file on **double‑line breaks (`\n\n`)** to create “chunks”.  
Each chunk should contain a **self‑contained piece of information** (e.g., a single field or a short group of related fields).  
That makes the retrieval step more accurate because the LLM receives only the most relevant snippet.
Below is a **ready‑to‑copy template** you can paste into a plain‑text file (UTF‑8, `.txt`).  
Feel free to add, delete, or reorder courses – just keep the blank line between chunks.
